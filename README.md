## The Breakpoint Sort
Implement the algorithm for the Breakpoint Sort that consists of three functions. First function `FindSorted()` will
find an index where the unsorted part of the permutation starts e.i. it will mark the position of the first breakpoint. 
The second function `IndicateAscending()` will create a vector of the same length as the permutation and mark ascending 
parts by ones and descending parts by zeros. Finally, the last function `BreakpointSort()` will perform sorting by 
reversals.

### Task 1
* In R, create a function `FindSorted()` to find an index, at which the unsorted part starts.

* Input:
    * A vector (permutation) of integers e.g. `0 1 2 3 6 7 4 5 8`.

* Output:
    * An index, at which the unsorted part starts e.g. `5`.

> **Hint**: 
> Compare successively values of the permutation with an increasing number starting at zero (`0`, `1`, `2` ...) 
> and ending at length of the permutation - 1. The comparison ends when the value in permutation is not the same as 
> the tested value or when the tested value is equal to the length of the permutation - 1.

FindSorted <- function(perm) {
  # Iterate through permutation and check expected sorted positions
  for (i in seq_along(perm)) {
    if (perm[i] != (i - 1)) {
      return(i)  # Return the index where mismatch occurs
    }
  }
  
  # If everything matched (already sorted), return length + 1
  return(length(perm) + 1)
}

perm <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 4, 5, 8)
FindSorted(perm)


### Task 2
* In R, create a function `IndicateAscending()` to mark ascending and descending parts of a permutation.

* Input:
    * A vector (permutation) of integers e.g. `0 4 5 3 2 1 6 7 8`.

* Output:
    * A vector of zeros and ones, where ascending parts are marked by `1` and descending by `0` e.g. `1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1`.

> **Hint:**
> Create an indication vector of the same length as the permutation containing only `0` values, and then set the first
> and last values to `1`. The ascending parts of the permutation vector will be marked with `1` values in the indication
> vector. Create a loop that iterates through the permutation and if two values next to each other are ascending, 
> i.e. the second is the first + 1, then the indication vector is set to `1` at the given indexes.

IndicateAscending <- function(perm) {
  n <- length(perm)
  
  # Start with all zeros
  indication <- rep(0, n)
  
  # First and last values always marked as 1 (according to hint)
  indication[1] <- 1
  indication[n] <- 1
  
  # Loop to mark ascending parts
  for (i in 1:(n - 1)) {
    if (perm[i + 1] == perm[i] + 1) {
      indication[i] <- 1
      indication[i + 1] <- 1
    }
  }
  return(indication)
}

perm <- c(0, 4, 5, 3, 2, 1, 6, 7, 8)
IndicateAscending(perm)


### Task 3
* In R, create a function `BreakpointSort()` to sort a permutation using Breakpoint Sort.

* Input:
    * A vector (permutation) of integers e.g. `5 1 4 3 7 8 9 2 6`.

* Output:
    * Sorted vector (permutation) of integers e.g. `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`.

> **Hint:** Add marginal values to the permutation and the following steps are repeated in a loop:
> * find the start of the unsorted region,
> * mark ascending/descending parts,
> * find the smallest value that is marked as descending part,
> * reversal between the start of the unsorted region and the smallest value marked as descending part.
>
> The loop ends when the permutation is sorted. Watch out for collision situations i.e. no parts marked as descending 
> or there is a single value marked as descending in front of the sorted part of the permutation.

BreakpointSort <- function(perm) {
  # Add marginal values (-1 at start, max+1 at end)
  perm <- c(-1, perm, length(perm))
  
  repeat {
    start <- FindSorted(perm)
    if (start > length(perm) - 1) break
    
    indication <- IndicateAscending(perm)
    
    # Find descending positions after 'start'
    desc_positions <- which(indication == 0 & seq_along(indication) > start)
    
    # If no descending left â†’ sorted
    if (length(desc_positions) == 0) break
    
    # Get smallest descending value position
    end <- desc_positions[which.min(perm[desc_positions])]
    
    # Reversal
    perm[start:end] <- rev(perm[start:end])
  }
  
  # Remove marginal values
  perm[-c(1, length(perm))]
}

perm <- c(5, 1, 4, 3, 7, 8, 9, 2, 6)
BreakpointSort(perm)
