## The Breakpoint Sort
Implement the algorithm for the Breakpoint Sort that consists of three functions. First function `FindSorted()` will
find an index where the unsorted part of the permutation starts e.i. it will mark the position of the first breakpoint. 
The second function `IndicateAscending()` will create a vector of the same length as the permutation and mark ascending 
parts by ones and descending parts by zeros. Finally, the last function `BreakpointSort()` will perform sorting by 
reversals.

### Task 1
* In R, create a function `FindSorted()` to find an index, at which the unsorted part starts.

* Input:
    * A vector (permutation) of integers e.g. `0 1 2 3 6 7 4 5 8`.

* Output:
    * An index, at which the unsorted part starts e.g. `5`.

> **Hint**: 
> Compare successively values of the permutation with an increasing number starting at zero (`0`, `1`, `2` ...) 
> and ending at length of the permutation - 1. The comparison ends when the value in permutation is not the same as 
> the tested value or when the tested value is equal to the length of the permutation - 1.

### Task 2
* In R, create a function `IndicateAscending()` to mark ascending and descending parts of a permutation.

* Input:
    * A vector (permutation) of integers e.g. `0 4 5 3 2 1 6 7 8`.

* Output:
    * A vector of zeros and ones, where ascending parts are marked by `1` and descending by `0` e.g. `1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1`.

> **Hint:**
> Create an indication vector of the same length as the permutation containing only `0` values, and then set the first
> and last values to `1`. The ascending parts of the permutation vector will be marked with `1` values in the indication
> vector. Create a loop that iterates through the permutation and if two values next to each other are ascending, 
> i.e. the second is the first + 1, then the indication vector is set to `1` at the given indexes.


### Task 3
* In R, create a function `BreakpointSort()` to sort a permutation using Breakpoint Sort.

* Input:
    * A vector (permutation) of integers e.g. `5 1 4 3 7 8 9 2 6`.

* Output:
    * Sorted vector (permutation) of integers e.g. `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`.

> **Hint:** Add marginal values to the permutation and the following steps are repeated in a loop:
> * find the start of the unsorted region,
> * mark ascending/descending parts,
> * find the smallest value that is marked as descending part,
> * reversal between the start of the unsorted region and the smallest value marked as descending part.
>
> The loop ends when the permutation is sorted. Watch out for collision situations i.e. no parts marked as descending 
> or there is a single value marked as descending in front of the sorted part of the permutation.
